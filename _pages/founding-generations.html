             As democracies around the world reorient themselves to prepare for the post-COVID era, this book is a timely work of history. The socioeconomic disruptions caused by the pandemic provide an apt opportunity to ruminate on how our democratic institutions originated in the first place. Utilizing the personal writings of the founding fathers and various historical works, this book provides valuable insights from the origins of the world's oldest democracy, the United States of America, and the world's largest democracy, India, to guide us through our contemporary dilemmas. Racism, Ultranationalism, Economic Inequality, Checks and Balances of Power, Religious Freedom, etc. were debated in various ways by the founding generations in their own times. This book shows how the founding generations tackled these issues to make America and India the beacons of Democracy and Pluralism.

             It would have taken more than a trite, monotonous, and chronological account of history to help readers visualize the parallels between the origins of these democracies. Therefore, this book weaves a narrative around six themes—Minorities, Power, Opposition, Equality, Nationalism, and Compromises—that are central to the effective working of any democracy. With feedback from acclaimed historians and scholars, this book categorically breaks down the key events from the founding times that have ever since influenced the trajectories of these democracies.
