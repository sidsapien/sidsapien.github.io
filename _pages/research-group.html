                <br>
                Investigate and model human physiological responses to improve cognitive well-being, and enhance human safety, productivity, and creativity.
            </div>

            <div style="color:#696969; text-align: justify;"><u>Vision</u>
            <br>
             My research group is dedicated to enhancing human cognitive well-being by taking a multi-modal sensory approach. Our approach involves the use of bio-sensors, computer vision, and electro-mechanical sensors to detect and model changes in human physiological responses (such as but not limited to neural activity, facial expressions, heart-rate variability, pupillometry, and galvanic skin response). 
            <br>
            By integrating domain-specific knowledge from the fields of signal processing, computational neuroscience, computer vision, and machine learning, we utilize human physiological responses to track various cognitive states such as emotions, stress, awareness, mental load, and more.
            <br>
            Our interdisciplinary approach provides insights into the complex interplay between technology and human cognition. These strategies can result in enhanced safety, productivity, and creativity for individuals in their environments. Our research findings are aimed at contributing to the academic understanding of cognitive states and their impact on human behavior. Additionally, our research and recommendations have practical applications in the technology industry for the development of safer and more user-centered designs that promote cognitive well-being.</div>

            <div style="color:#696969; text-align: justify;"><u>Ongoing Projects</u>             
                <br>
                • Monitoring Emotions and Cognitive Well-being through physiological responses in the real-world through a wrist wearable.
                <br>
                • Using wearables and computer vision to monitor human safety in industrial and driving environments to mitigate untoward incidents.
                <br>
                • Tracking productivity and creativity, and mitigating mental workload while users interact with technology.
                <br>
                • Utilizing computer vision towards generating a “real-like” human avatar for the Metaverse (with the ability to try on various wardrobe choices remotely).</div>

            <div style="color:#696969; text-align: justify;"><u>Prospective Students</u>
            <br>
             I am actively looking for motivated students to work on the above projects (or other ideas as well). If you are interested in joining my research group at Plaksha University in any role or would like to collaborate, please send me a note at siddharth.s[at]plaksha.edu.in</div>
