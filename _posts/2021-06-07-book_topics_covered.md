<li>The rise and fall of Indiaâ€™s first Free-market political party, the Swatantra Party, and how it temporarily pushed back Nehruâ€™s socialist policies.</li>
<li>The complex relationship between Nehru and Patel, and how they subsumed their differences so that the newly-Independent India would not fall apart.</li>
